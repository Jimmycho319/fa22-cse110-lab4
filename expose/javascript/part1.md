1. Line 9 would print 30 
2. Line 13 would print 30
3. Line 9 would give us 30 however this would not be printed either because we would be getting an error from the code because we are trying to access a varible that is declared outside of the scope in line 13
4. Line 13 would give us an error because we are using result outside of its declared scope and so we are not able to access 'result'
5. Line 9 would not be able to print the correct value because line 7 would give us an error. We are trying to change the value of a const variable which will lead to an error. 
6. The same error as line 9 but also we are trying to declare a variable that is out of scope so we will get two errors.
